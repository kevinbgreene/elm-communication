# Elm Communication

A sample application demonstrating two-way module communication in Elm.

[Two-way Module Communication in Elm](https://medium.com/@KevinBGreene/two-way-module-communication-in-elm-7cd5896df37c)


There are two branches in this repo demonstrating the two patterns I have used.


To checkout managing two-way communication using only module state:

```
$ git checkout using-state
```


To checkout managing two-way communication with messaging:

```
$ git checkout beacons
```
